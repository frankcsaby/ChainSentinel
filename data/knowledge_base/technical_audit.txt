RISK KNOWLEDGE BASE: TECHNICAL SECURITY AUDIT
---------------------------------------------
1. AUDIT STATUS:
   - Gold Standard: Audited by CertiK, Hacken, or OpenZeppelin.
   - Medium Risk: Audited by unknown/small firms.
   - High Risk: "No Audit" or "Audit in progress".

2. OWNERSHIP RENOUNCED:
   - Safe: Contract ownership is "renounced" (nobody can change the code anymore).
   - Risky: Ownership is active. The owner can potentially mint new tokens (hyperinflation), change taxes, or pause trading.

3. MINT FUNCTION:
   - Critical Risk: If the contract has a "Mint()" function accessible by the owner, they can print infinite tokens and dump them on the market.

RISK KNOWLEDGE BASE: MARKET MANIPULATION
----------------------------------------
1. WASH TRADING:
   - Definition: The developer buys and sells their own token to create fake volume and attract investors.
   - Indicators:
     * High trading volume but price doesn't move.
     * Transactions happen at exact intervals (bot activity).

2. SNIPER BOTS:
   - Definition: Bots that buy a token in the same second it launches.
   - Risk: They pump the price up immediately and dump on real investors minutes later.

3. LIQUIDITY TO MARKET CAP RATIO:
   - Healthy: Liquidity is at least 10-20% of the Market Cap.
   - Suspicious: High Market Cap ($10M) but very low Liquidity ($5k). This means you cannot sell large amounts without crashing the price (High Slippage).
